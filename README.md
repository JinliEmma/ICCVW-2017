Deep Learning Based Hand Detection in Cluttered Environment Using Skin Segmentation

This repository contains a new dataset that we have proposed in our paper in ICCVW 2017 titeled "Deep Learning Based Hand Detection in Cluttered Environment Using Skin Segmentation". This contains 657 high resolution dance frames from 7 videos captured by us. We have resized these frames for our experimentation. We are also providing the resized frames in a separate folder.




If you use this dataset for your research. Please cite our paper.
